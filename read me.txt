Create new service, ShopifyService to manage authentication, pull products/qtys, locations and update qtys. Refer to existing services that do the same (Vend, Xero, Kounta).

Create new controller, ShopifyController to work along side ShopifyService. Refer to existing controllers that do the same (Vend, Xero, Kounta).

Authentication (https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started/authentication)

This will perform OAuth authentication for a Public app.
You will need to implement the backend controller & service code to talk to Shopify.
We have existing integrations implementing OAuth 2.0 already, so much of the framework is already in place that you can follow & replicate.
UI modifications are also required, but fairly minimal.  Again we have example integrations already, so it's just extending what we already have.
Once you have obtained the access token, we already have code to handle storage and retrieval of the token in the database, that is shared with other integrations.
Retrieving tracked inventory details and levels (https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/products &  https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/inventory/inventoryitem)

Fields required include Inventory Item Id, SKU, Barcode, Title, Product Type, Inventory Qty, Cost.  Note: Cost will require the inventoryitem endpoint.
You will need to retrieve all products from Shopify, and store in the database.
We have the appropriate code to handle saving this data to our database, you just need to retrieve the product information and massage into the correct format.
Retrieving locations (https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/inventory/location)

Fields required include Name & Code (abbreviation of Name).
You will need to retrieve all locations from Shopify, and store in the database.
We have the appropriate code to handle saving this data to our database, you just need to retrieve the product information and massage into the correct format.
Updating tracked inventory levels to Shopify (https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/inventory/inventorylevel)

Fields required include Inventory Item Id, Location Id, Inventory Qty.
This will require a post back to Shopfiy per inventory item & location, to update the quantity after a stocktake/inventory count is complete.
We have the appropriate code to handle retrieving products from our database, you just need to post back to Shopify in the appropriate format.
